As of today, the Top Level Domain (TLD) **.dev** is available at a reasonable price. [Go get yours!](https://get.dev/) ðŸ¤“

Along with the coolness of having your business, personal page, side-project or portfolio on a .dev domain, it also offers built-in security. That is, HTTPS is enforced for all connections to your .dev site. 

I just bought mine for like 15 USD/year- [davidojeda.dev](https://davidojeda.dev). Right now it only redirects to my personal page currently hosted at [davidojeda.mx](https://davidojeda.mx), but will make the .dev domain the main one!


Have you bought one yet?
