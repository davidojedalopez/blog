Hello everyone! ðŸ––ðŸ¼


I have been coding for around 2.5 years now; 1.5 of those just learning and building really small stuff, the rest actually working as a software developer. 

You can find me on Twitter as [@DavidOjedaL](https://twitter.com/DavidOjedaL). I usually post/retweet code related info, but lately have been getting into running too ðŸƒðŸ½ðŸ’¨ 

I live in Guadalajara, MÃ©xico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½

I work for Handy. We develop and maintain a sales workforce automation mobile and web application (also called Handy). We basically help companies sell more by providing visibility and control of sales operations, and tools for the sales people.  

I mostly program in Groovy and JavaScript. Our web application is developed using Grails and we have a couple of microservices running on Nodejs. 

I am currently learning more about DevOps and Machine Learning.

Recurrent reader of so much awesome content here on dev.to, and just decided to start writing some stuff myself!

I am also a huuuuge fan of Overwatch, so if anyone's looking for some great matches, do talk to me ðŸ˜‹



Nice to meet you all!
