I started the #100DaysOfCode challenge on XXXXX and finished it on XXXX. Yeah, that's way more than 100 days ðŸ¤” 

For those who don't know, the #100DaysOfCode challenge consists on **coding at least hour every day for the next 100 days**. Every day during this period you also must:
- Tweet your progress using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
- Engage with at least two other people doing the challenge.

The purpose of the challenge is help you form a habit, and to meet other people doing the same. [Check the full challenge description on their official page](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

When I started this challenge, I was at a point in life where I was looking to improve many of my current habits and being more active in Twitter, and the challenge was blend of both.

I want to share some thoughts about this journey and the challenge itself since **I have mixed feelings**. Before I go on, just a quick context about my experience as a software dev:
- I've been working as software developer professionally for around 4 years.
- I code every weekday at work.

Let's get to it. 

## Public commit is real

It can help you build a habit, if you didn't have one.

**ADD SOMETHING ABOUT LEARN IN PUBLIC**

## It's daunting to do anything 100 times in a row

Starting to form a habit by doing one thing, for at least one hour, for 100 days in a row, is like rolling out a snowball uphill. It will eventually grow so big that it will crush you.

When I formed my habit of working out, it didn't started by saying: "I'm gonna exercise for one hour for the next 100 days". That's exactly how you **don't create a habit**. 

You'll probably start highly motivated the first few weeks, but believe, life get's in the way. You'll eventually start to fell off because it's a HUGE commitment. And it's specially hard if you are just starting out developing. 

It's like starting to run before you crawl.

Instead, to create my exercise habit I said: "I'm gonna exercise for at least five minutes, three times a week". The secret is that five minutes is more manageable, and for that reason is more probable that you start.

Once you start, you'll find yourself doing more than five minutes because, well, you are already there with your gym clothes on. 

You build up from there, now like a snowball down a hill.

## Missing one day is not the end of the world

I wish this previous sentence was part of the challenge's website.

Whenever I couldn't find a time slot to work on the challenge I felt anxious. Even if no one would even notice that I missed one day. Not even your all-time-friends bots.

But you already committed publicly to the challenge! You feel pressure. And many days what I would do was just open my computer, do some silly change to my code, and tweet about it. Damn, I even felt stupid sharing changes so small that where nowhere near the 1 hour commit I should be doing. **ADD A TWEET HERE**.

## Enjoy the journey

Engage and learn from others. I believe that's the most valuable takeaway of this challenge.

The rules and hashtag encourages you to comment on other's people work; positive vibes only ðŸ¤—. You meet new people,
