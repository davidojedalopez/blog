Hello Devs 👋🏼

I want to showcase an app I've been working on for the past few weeks. It aims to solve the pains I have when writing my blog posts:

- I can't remember the Markdown syntax to create a link or image. Is it () or [] first? 🤔
- Different post destinations use different formats; HTML, Markdown, etc.
- I don't like to use apps that don't respect my privacy, e.g., Grammarly.

I made a video tour of my work so far; bare with me please since I'm terrible at video 😅

## A brief summary:

A **blog post writing app** to **write your content once**, and **publish it anywhere** you want.

Main features:
 - No specific syntax required, write with common text processor tools 👌🏼.
 - Grammar and insensitive checks out of the box; nothing leaves your browser 🖍.
 - Automatic browser storage to avoid losing your content 🔄.
 - Easy and intuitive image uploads 🌠.
 - Post **directly to DEV.to as a draft** 😱.
 - Export as Markdown or HTML ⬇️.

I'd like for this app to also help me follow a template or style, which I'm still trying to find. I'll see how to add that in the near future.

Any feedback is really appreciated! 🙏🏼 And if you want to try it out, let me know! 

**UPDATE: My app has a name! It's called Nina, like my dog 🐕.**

Thanks a lot 💙
