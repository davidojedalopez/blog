I've worked with AWS at my job for around two years. I don't proclaim myself an expert or something alike, but surely I've learned a lot during this time. 

A couple of months ago I decided to commit and study to get an AWS certification- AWS Solutions Architect. That's why I'm creating a series of posts such as tutorials, guides and tips/tricks on AWS. 

There are tons of things I need to learn and deeply understand, and I think teaching them is the most effective way to learn them.

**Would love any feedback, corrections and/or suggestions on the series' posts!** Also, I'm going to re:Invent 2018 by myself, if anyone wants to hang out there feel free to talk to me!

Thanks a lot, fam! ❤️

I will be updating this post whenever I create a new post for the series.
